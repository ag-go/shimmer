Image transformation in wasm using Go.

**LIVE DEMO** at https://agniva.me/shimmer/

Just a demo project done on a weekend to play with images inside the browser using WASM. Performance lag is noticeable for images over 100KB.

### Setup

- Run `make build-prod`
- Serve the files using any HTTP server. (Note that .wasm files need to be served with `application/wasm` mime type. So the server must be capable of doing that.)

### Benchmarks

```
name         time/op
AdjustImage   249ms ± 4%

name         alloc/op
AdjustImage  2.44MB ± 0%

name         allocs/op
AdjustImage    62.0 ± 0%
```
